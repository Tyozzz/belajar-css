<p>Three Ways to Insert CSS
    There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
    
    External CSS
    Internal CSS
    Inline CSS

    External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
